<p>THIS MAIL MIGHT COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AND THE TEMPTATION TO IGNORE IT
AS UNSERIOUS COULD COME INTO YOUR MIND BUT PLEASE CONSIDER IT A DIVINE
WISH AND ACCEPT IT WITH A DEEP SENSE OF HUMILITY. I AM MRS HELEN GEORGE
AND I AM A 61 YEARS OLD WOMAN. I AM A SOUTH AFRICAN MARRIED TO A SIERRA
LEONIA.</p>

<p>I WAS THE PRESIDENT/CEO OF OIL COMPANY INTERNATIONAL-AN OIL SERVICING
COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG. I WAS ALSO MARRIED WITH NO CHILD. MY HUSBAND
DIED 3YEARS AGO. BEFORE THIS HAPPENED MY BUSINESS AND CONCERN FOR MAKING
MONEY WAS ALL I WAS LIVING FOR AND I NEVER REALLY CARED ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE. BUT SINCE THE LOSS OF MY HUSBAND AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAD HAVE NO
CHILD TO CALL MY OWN, I HAVE FOUND A NEW DESIRE TO ASSIST THE HELPLESS, I
HAVE BEEN HELPING ORPHANS IN ORPHANAGES/MOTHERLESS HOMES/HUMANITARIANS. I
HAVE DONATED SOME MONEY TO ORPHANS IN SUDAN,ETHIOPIA, CAMEROON, SPAIN,
AUSTRIA, GERMANY AND SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES.</p>

<p>IN SUMMARY:- I HAVE 12,000,000.00 (TWELVE MILLION) U. S. DOLLARS WHICH I
DEPOSITED IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN COTONOU BENIN REPUBLIC AS A FAMILY
TREASURE & ARTEFACTS, PLEASE I WANT YOU TO NOTE THAT THE SECURITY
COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW THE REAL CONTENT TO BE MONEY AND I WANT YOU TO
ASSIST ME IN CLAIMING THE CONSIGNMENT & DISTRIBUTING THE MONEY TO CHARITY
ORGANIZATIONS, I AGREE TO REWARD YOU WITH PART OF THE MONEY FOR YOUR
ASSISTANCE, KINDNESS AND PARTICIPATION IN THIS GODLY PROJECT. BEFORE I
BECAME ILL, I KEPT $12 MILLION IN A LONG-TERM DEPOSIT IN A SECURITY
COMPANY WHICH I DECLARED AS A FAMILY TREASURE ARTIFIARTS.I AM IN THE
HOSPITAL WHERE I HAVE BEEN UNDERGOING TREATMENT
FOR OESOPHAGEAL CANCER AND MY DOCTORS HAVE TOLD ME THAT I HAVE ONLY A FEW
MONTHS TO LIVE.</p>

<p>IT IS MY LAST WISH TO SEE THIS MONEY DISTRIBUTED TO CHARITY
ORGANIZATIONS. BECAUSE MY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS HAVE PLUNDERED SO MUCH OF
MY WEALTH SINCE MY ILLNESS, I CANNOT LIVE WITH THE AGONY OF ENTRUSTING
THIS HUGE RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY OF THEM. PLEASE, I BEG YOU IN THE NAME OF
GOD TO HELP ME COLLECT THE $12 MILLION WHICH I DEPOSIT WITH THE NAME OF
MY LATE HUSBAND AS THE NEXT OF KIN BECAUSE NOW DUE TO MY HEALTH THE
SECURITY COMPANY IS DEMANDING FOR A NEXT OF KIN IN OTHER TO GET THE MONEY
TRANSFERRED IN OTHER TO SEE THAT MY LAST WISH IS ACCOMPLISHED WHICH IS
SHARING THE MONEY AMONG CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS.YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO USE
YOUR DISCRETION TO DISTRIBUTE THE MONEY AND FEEL FREE AS WELL TO
